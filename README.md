Things i make for work. Software, energy systems, controls, and more.

Theese include the energy management system (controls lighting based on time, light level, if park is open or closed etc.)

Software - Mainly HMI's that i work on to contact and control PLC's.

Controls - Programs i write for PLC's. Theese will be for things like motor control props etc

Finally i will have projects i write for arduinos or change to work for our stuff. This will be where you can get music players controlled by arduino.
